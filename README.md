# Transport-Demand-Prediction
In this project I have build a model that predicts the number of seats that Mobiticket can expect to sell for each ride, i.e. for a specific route on a specific date and time. There are 14 routes in this datasetand all of the routes end in Nairobi and originate in towns to the North-West of Nairobi towards Lake Victoria.

# Data Description
Nairobi Transport Data.csv (zipped) is the dataset of tickets purchased from Mobiticket for the 14 routes from “up country” into Nairobi between 17 October 2017 and 20 April 2018. This dataset includes the variables: ride_id, seat_number, payment_method, payment_receipt, travel_date, travel_time, travel_from, travel_to, car_type, max_capacity.
Uber Movement traffic data can be accessed here. Data is available for Nairobi through June 2018. Uber Movement provided historic hourly travel time between any two points in Nairobi. Any tables that are extracted from the Uber Movement platform can be used in your model.

# Variables description:
* ride_id: unique ID of a vehicle on a specific route on a specific day and time.
* seat_number: seat assigned to ticket
* payment_method: method used by customer to purchase ticket from Mobiticket (cash or Mpesa)
* payment_receipt: unique id number for ticket purchased from Mobiticket
* travel_date: date of ride departure. (MM/DD/YYYY)
* travel_time: scheduled departure time of ride. Rides generally depart on time. (hh:mm)
* travel_from: town from which ride originated
* travel_to: destination of ride. All rides are to Nairobi.
* car_type: vehicle type (shuttle or bus)
* max_capacity: number of seats on the vehicle

Steps:
* Data Summary
* Ride Origination Towns
* Travel time
* Quarterly Trend
* Month wise booking trends
* Feature Engineering
* ML Models and Metrics

# Conclusion
We used diffent type of regression algorithms to train our model like, Linear Regression, Regularized linear regression (Ridge and Lasso), GBM,Random Forest Regressor, XGboost regresssor. and Also we tuned the parameters of Random forest regressor and XGboost regressor and also found the important features for training the model. Out of them XGboost with tuned hyperparameters gave the best result.
